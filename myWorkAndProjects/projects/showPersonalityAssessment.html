                The Personality Assessment consists of 10 questions asking someone about their life and how they would react in some situations. After submitting the assessment, the user will receive one of the four results as their mood: sad, elated, angry or neutral. This assessment is for the user to answer the 10 questions honestly, and this assessment would give a result that closely resembles how they could be feeling. If the feeling is not accurate and a person receives a result they do not agree with, they can be more aware that they can make changes to improve their lifestyle and if necessary, it is encouraged to receive help from a professional if a person is struggling with behavioral or personal issues.
