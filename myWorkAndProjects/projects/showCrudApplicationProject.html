                CRUD is short for four words: Create, Read, Update and Delete. These four operations are used to either make (create) new files, access (read) a saved file without making changes, make changes (update) to previous file or dispose (delete) of a file respectively. These operations are often mentioned and used when working with databases. Databases are often used in the technology industry and making websites functional as they can be used to store saved files and afterwards access those files for future use. This application is created for beginners to understand how CRUD works, by using those four operations to create, read, update, and delete any information. This application is created so that all existing information is wiped out in a minute.
